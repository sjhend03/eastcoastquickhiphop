        description: 'Rap\'s original audience was young working-class African-Americans. At this time, rap was full of oral history, political advocacy, and literary fetishism. As time went on, hip-hop gained popularity and started changing to be more commercialized. “We were a product of what hate produced. We were taught to hate ourselves, so a lot of it is breemed of ignorance”, Chuck D, a rapper who started his career in the mid-1980 \'s, speaks on the changing of the lyrical content of political advocacy and discontent, to lyrics about \'the pimp, the playa, and the gansta\' (Blanchard). He states that most of the black-on-black violence was a product of the system in which the people grew up. It is important to know this when looking at hip-hop as this is the time that a lot of music started getting hateful about having a bad influence. The music wasn\'t about the violence but, about where the violence came from. It was still the same voice for discontent but now spoken in a way that doesn\'t paint the people making money from the music as the bad guys. Looking at another analysis, Michael McGuire, a student from Dalhousie University, says "The power of rap music, like earlier forms of Black musical expression, is rooted in its awareness of difference - specifically in the socioeconomic spheres inhabited by North American (and, increasingly, global) Blacks – and of separateness from White-dominated mainstream culture." (McGuire). The importance of rap music is clear, i\'s a voice; it is a voice of the African-American population of America and allows critiquing of the world. As rap music gains popularity and starts being controlled and monetized, unfortunately, this voice gets lost in most mainstream music. Eventually, it comes back but, the effects of the industry surrounding music are easily seen in the lyrics of rap songs.',

        description: 'Rap was now changing but it\'s roots was still there. The 90s brought names like Nas, Wu-Tang, and a Tribe Called Quest from the east coast as well as names like Ice Cube, Dre, and Snoop from the west coast. Rap held significant importance in the working class African-Americans of the U.S. Rap was able to expose problems, discrimination, and problems that riddled America at the time. Unfortunately, the media would often speak negatively about rap as a bad influence on the youth. “We do things on a small level, but America does it on a big level. It aint just us. White people do everything we do” (Blanchard), Ice Cube, a rapper from LA who became popular in the 90s, speaks on his disdain for America at the time. These themes are important to music and culture. He later goes on to talk about how the lyrics about violence weren\'t to brag but, a cry for help. Going back to the East Coast, Wu-Tang, a rap group from Staten Island, New York, was pushing the music, message, and sound forward. Wu-Tang would help to create the darker and more hardcore style of east-coast hip-hop and bring back the lyrics against the system and other big corporations.\n"They tryin\' to take us back to Reaganomics with atomic bombs\nOn Islamic countries to stop them from being Islamic\nBut Islam is a way of life, Islam is the way of Christ\nIslam means peace, the beast must pay a price\nFor his wickedness, politics is the trickiest\nBusiness on this planet, the bandits are the slipperiest\nSnakes who ever slithered, you ever stop to consider\nWho\'s pulling these strings, from Napoleon to Hitler?\nIs there an unseen hand with the unseen plan?\nThe unclean man from the unclean land\nDesire to kill the righteous dumbs down the brightest\nGive his life in this world that seems so lifeless\nPut a price on things, that are priceless\nThe fierceness that meanness is stronger than the niceness\nWho really has the power, it is theirs, is it ours?\nIs it a democracy, or the morning prowlers?\nDo we have a press or President?\nIs it a test or a testament? Pest or pestilence?\nWho got the evidence?\nWho got the common sense? Stop all the negligence" (Start the Show, Wu-Tang Clan).',

        description: 'Following previous hip-hop groups like Wu-Tang, a group called the Diplomats (DipSet) formed in 1997. DipSet held members such as Cam\'ron, who was originally part of the group "Children of the Corn", Freekey Zekey, Jim Jones, and Juelz Santana. \n"When we discovered DipSet at the time, they totally influenced our generation. Everybody wanted to be DipSet at the time" (Genius), that quote is from an A$AP Rocky interview where he was asked about his influences. DipSet was pushing fashion, DVDs, and beefing with other groups like no one had seen before. This led to the gathering of a large cult following and influencing the next generation of hip-hop from the East Coast. Hip-Hop at this time was slowly changing as technology changed and was starting to be pushed to the internet as Y2K approached.',

        title: 'Raider Klan',
        image: raider_klan,
        description: 'Raider Klan was a Miami-centric hip-hop group that started around 2008. The group was started and fueled by SpaceGhostPurpp who is an underground hip-hop artist who rocked with a grim dark sound and brought back dark sounds into the music. The group would be a major influence in the internet era of hip-hop where artists would put out downloads of their music on message boards and their websites. Raider Klan had connections with A$AP and even inducted Rocky and Yams through a "candle-lit seance". SpaceGhostPurpp was anti-establishment and pushed that sentiment to the end leading to fallouts between Purpp, Rocky, and Denzel Curry (one of the Raider\'s most famous members). \n"[The beef] was a real thing. There were even times when shit got so out of hand, that I dissed A$AP at one point. Then I met Mark [Mutalah, my manager] and he taught me to question a lot of things about that beef. What I started to notice was egos in the clique were boiling over. People were looking at me as a traitor, because I didn’t want to sign a Raider Klan contract. And then I stopped dissing A$AP altogether. " (Matson), says Denzel Curry about the beef between A$AP and Raider Klan. Denzel goes on to elaborate that Purpp, the leader of the Raider Klan, was tried and true about his values and that is why in the end it didn\'t work out. Denzel also spoke on the impact he thought Raider Klan had said, "Raider Klan played its position well as fuck. It was when the egos got in the way. It was just a bunch of bitch ni&&a shit. And I just don’t want my generation to go through that. Like, the next generation. I like the new guys who are coming out. A lot of them need guidance because a lot of them are misguided. Purrp had [the quality of] guidance. He had some form of guidance." (Matson) He talks about how Raider Klan was the environment and guidance a lot of up incoming artists needed. Raider Klan was short-lived but showed how powerful rap could be in a community. ULT, a rap group started by Denzel Curry, contained a couple of Raider Klan members and showed just how close Raider Klan members were and how Raider Klan transcended just the music. The fashion, the sound, the lifestyle, they are all things that, at the time, were a part of the Raider Klan and its followers.',

        title: 'ASAP Mob',
        image: ASAP,
        description: 'A$AP Mob is another hip-hop group out of Harlem that was formed in 2009. It was started by Ills, Bari, and Yams. They took big influence from previous Harlem groups such as Dipset, Wu-Tang Clan, and Children of the Corn. Yams (Steven Rodriguez) helped direct A$AP to become one of the most prominent hip-hop groups in the game. He often used the internet to help promote the group\'s work which became very popular through his version of Tumblr that he created. A$AP in conjunction with other hip-hop groups at the time such as Odd Future and Raider Klan would help push hip-hop to the internet and eventually change the way music was listened to forever. A$AP and Raider Klan were closely connected with Yams and Rocky both being inducted into Raider Klan. SpaceGhostPurpp, Raider Klan\'s founder, helped Rocky release his first successful singles such as "Purple Swag". Unfortunately, Rocky and Purpp had a falling out because of a difference in vision and values. A$AP changed the sound of east-coast hip-hop by bringing in more melodic and underground sounds while keeping the classic Harlem and New York sound from DipSet and Wu-Tang. A$AP had planned to release their first project "LORDS" but was unfortunately canceled after Yams died. "Yams had a notebook with all the plans for us, what he wanted us to do, who he wanted us to fuck with..." (genius), A$AP Ferg speaks on Yam\'s death and how he impacted A$AP as a whole. This shows how impactful Yams was to A$AP and the hip-hop scene as a whole. Yams changed how hip-hop was consumed and what it meant on the internet. Now, A$AP members hold an annual Yams day in celebration of him every year with acts from different musicians and A$AP members.',

        description: 'Today, artists from these groups are still popular and active. DipSet\'s Cam\'ron is still making music with moderate success; A$AP Rocky of A$AP Mob, and Denzel curry from Raider Klan, are some of the most popular artists today making new music, influencing fashion, and changing culture. A$AP Rocky has become more of a fashion icon than a musician, he models for Dior and Calvin Klein. Denzel Curry still makes music and was nominated for a Grammy this year. We can see the influence of these groups and the east coast on the sound, culture, and style of music today. One of the most interesting things to recognize about these groups is that they both were making music around the same time as the internet was becoming more accessible. Being the first on the internet also meant they set the standards, standards that we see today. "He showcases the young Black men as vulnerable “good kids” who have no choice but to live in these conditions: “Joey packed the nine, / Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime / Pack a van with four guns at a time / With the sliding door, fuck is up?” (Lamar 2012b) The reality Kendrick Lamar knows is that in hoods such as Compton a young man needs to adapt to the criminal lifestyle and belong to one street gang or another to be part of the community, even though it is dangerous and by no means glamorous or a good choice." (Máthé), this analysis of Kendrick Lamar\'s lyrics by Máthé is spot on about how rap has changed. Today, rap is digging deeper and becoming more transparent about the problems of old. Older rap uses motifs like "the pimp, the playa, and the gangsta" (Blanchard), while rap today tends to be more open towards the problems and not mask them behind violent lyrics talking about the same things. Regardless, hip-hop is art, and whether or not it is someone using a more vulgar style or someone going for more emotional and melodic, the original roots of using lyrics to talk about discontent, politics, and discrimination are still there. The changing of these lyrics shows perfectly how the culture has changed, as artists can talk about more emotional and deep topics, so can the listener.',
